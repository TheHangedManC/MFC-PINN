Important Statement: This code is derived from https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0263224124008807 and is intended for learning and academic exchange. If this code is referenced in the paper, please cite this article. The code is not allowed to be used for commercial purposes. 
The folder contains TDOA methods, which can be compared with the code proposed in this article. The source waveform data is stored in the "Waveform" folder. The delta_t file contains time difference parameters and can be used for TDOA positioning. 
The "Model" folder stores MFC-PINN code under four conditions: complete dataset, incomplete dataset, incomplete dataset with SNR = 5dB, and incomplete dataset with SNR = -5dB. There are files of various sizes in these folders, such as 15-1, which represents taking 15 data points per PLB point, according to the data partition method in the first category of the paper (the partitioning method for the complete and incomplete datasets is different). 
Readers can find the labels with time difference parameter information in the "dataset" folder (only time difference parameters are used in the test set; coordinate information is used only for error analysis with measured coordinates). This folder also contains "CWT" files used to store continuous wavelet transform spectrograms. 
The "Model" folder also contains PINN and CNN models for comparison, with the CNN-PINN model being the MFC-PINN model proposed in this paper. Since the model and weight files are large, the pre-trained models are not uploaded. Readers can run the "main" function and select the model they want to run. After the first run of a particular dataset, the dataset will be saved in .npy format in the corresponding folder in the "dataset" folder. The models are stored in the "result" folder under the corresponding dataset folder in the model folder. For the specific structure and parameters of the model, refer to the CNN-PINN.py file.
